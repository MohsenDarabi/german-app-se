## Legacy Lessons

**Location**: `content-archive/legacy-v1/`

| Level | Lessons | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| A1 | 54 | Old curriculum, some useful content |
| A2 | 24 | Old curriculum |

**Total**: 78 lessons

These were created without the Babbel+Busuu fusion approach. Some vocabulary and grammar content may be reusable.

## Legacy Multimedia Tasks

**Location**: `content-archive/legacy-multimedia-tasks/`

| Type | Count |
|------|-------|
| Images | 274 |
| Videos | 28 |
| **Total** | 302 |

These tasks were created for the legacy lessons. The task descriptions may be useful as reference for creating new tasks, but the specific step IDs won't match new fusion lessons.

**Key files**:
- `START-HERE.md` - Master checklist (302 tasks)
- `A1-M01-L01.json`, etc. - Per-lesson task files

---

## When to Reference

Use legacy content when:
1. Need example task descriptions
2. Looking for vocabulary coverage ideas
3. Checking what grammar topics were covered

**Do NOT**:
- Copy lesson JSON directly (schema may have changed)
- Use step IDs from legacy tasks (won't match new lessons)
- Assume multimedia tasks are still valid
